 * Creating a dashboard for sales data that involves ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a multi-step process.
   Here's a breakdown of the steps involved, from gathering data to building and deploying the dashboard

 
Post-ETL Process: Dashboard Development (Including Cards & KPIs)
After the ETL process, follow these steps for effective dashboard creation:

1. Upload Canvas Image
   Purpose: Upload branding images (logo, background) to customize the dashboard.
   Action: Use dashboarding tools to import images for design consistency.
2. Create Visualizations (Charts) According to Insights
   Use the following charts to represent key insights:

   A. Bar Chart: Profit-Loss by Monthly Analysis
      X-axis: Months
      Y-axis: Profit/Loss values (positive for profit, negative for loss)
   B. Bar Chart: Profit by Sub-Category
      X-axis: Sub-Categories (e.g., Electronics, Apparel)
      Y-axis: Profit values
   C. Donut Chart: Quantity by Category
      Slices: Categories (e.g., Electronics, Groceries)
      Value: Quantity Sold
   D. Donut Chart: Quantity by Payment Mode
      Slices: Payment Modes (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal)
      Value: Quantity Sold
   E. Bar Chart: Top States by Sales
      X-axis: Sales or Quantity
      Y-axis: States (e.g., California, Texas)
   F. Bar Chart: Top Customers by Sales
      X-axis: Customers
      Y-axis: Sales Value
3. Use of Cards and KPIs
   Cards: Use cards to display important aggregate values at a glance (e.g., Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Orders).

  Example: A card can display "Total Sales" = $1,500,000.

  KPIs (Key Performance Indicators): Show performance metrics that track business goals. These can be:

  Profit Margin (Profit/Sales)
  Year-over-Year Growth (Current Sales vs. Previous Year)
  Sales vs. Target (Actual vs. Goal)
  Customer Acquisition Rate
 Conversion Rate

4. Combine All Visuals in the Dashboard
   Layout: Arrange the charts and KPIs/cards logically.
   Filters: Add filters for date range, product category, region, etc.
   Interactivity: Ensure users can drill down and interact with the data.


 By above steps, build a robust and interactive sales data dashboard that provides valuable
  insights to your business and stakeholders.
